These files and programs are part of Myles Winkley's work for Dr. Hyunseob Kim to determine accurate values for insider share counts with a focus on dual-class firms.
Unfortunately due to size constraints of the files that these programs manipulate and the proprietary nature of the data, I am unable to provide the data files themselves.

For the Insider Ownership Directory:
	-For viewing STATA and SAS code navigate to the /Programs/ and /Programs/SAS/ directories respectively
	-For viewing construction methodology, reasoning, and some basic summary statistics/regressions about the method see "/Notes/Construction Walkthrough and Methodology.docx"


IMPORTANT: It is highly advised to view the construction methodology before looking at the SAS programs to provide some context for the manipulations being performed
