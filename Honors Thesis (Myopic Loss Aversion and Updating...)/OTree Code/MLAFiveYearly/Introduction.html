<p>
This experiment simulates a series of investment decisions.
 In this experiment, imagine that you are the investment
 manager for a small college's endowment. Every forty financial periods you must decide how you wish to split the college's assets  between two investments, which we label "Fund A" and "Fund B."  
</p>
 

<p>
You will be asked how much you wish to allocate to Fund A, an  integer from 0 (allocate nothing to Fund A) to 100 (allocate all assets to Fund A). Whatever you do not allocate to Fund A is allocated to Fund B. 

</p>

 
<p>
 After each decision you will receive information about the
 performance of Fund A, Fund B, and your overall return based on your decision. The information will be displayed on the
 screen as three bars showing the percentage return of Fund A,
 Fund B, and your decision. You will then be
 asked to make the decision for the next forty periods.
