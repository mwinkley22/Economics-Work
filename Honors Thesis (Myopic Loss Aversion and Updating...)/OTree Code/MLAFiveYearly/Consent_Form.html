<p>
I am asking you to participate in a research study exploring investment behavior in the presence of risk. I will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions.  This study is being led by Myles Winkley, Undergraduate in the Department of Economics. The Faculty Advisor for this study is Michele Belot, Department of Economics.	
</p>

<p>
What we will ask you to do:

We will ask you to allocate virtual assets between two simulated funds in a portfolio, acting as a manager of a collegeâ€™s endowment. Completion of all your decisions should take 15-30 minutes on average. Even though you may receive negative returns on your portfolio during the study, you will still receive monetary rewards from participation in this study. </p>

<p>
We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research.
</p>

<p>
Through this study, we hope to learn about the investment decisions of individuals.</p>

<p>
Compensation for participation:
You will receive compensation for your participation in this study and payment will increase based on performance. This will range from $5-15 depending on the decisions you will take, as well as chance, and you will be paid after the study has concluded, as your relative performance will partially determine your monetary reward. This payment will be in the form of Amazon Gift Cards delivered to an email address of your choice.
