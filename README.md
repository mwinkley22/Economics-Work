This directory contains a selection of my (Myles Winkley) work from previous research positions and projects. The folder named "Insider Ownership" contains the code I wrote to
include superior voting rights shares by engaging in systematic data cleaning of Thomson-Reuters share ownership files. The folder titled "Honors Thesis" contains the code for the data analysis
of my thesis, the thesis itself, and the Python code I added to the O-Tree platform to run my experiment.
